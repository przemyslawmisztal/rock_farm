Hobbit unit calculator
=========

Simple but useful Android application that calculates amount of T1 troops to train while making sure your available resources are spent the best efficient way.

## Quick start

1. Allow application installs from “unknown sources” (http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/open-distribution.html#unknown-sources).
2. Download APK on your PC and copy them to your phone, or download directly from your phone.
3. Install APK with the file manager.

## Usage

Enter amount for each of the resources that you have. As in game resource quantities are rather large app takes that units are in thousands. So if you have one million of food just type 1000. When you done just press OK to see how much units you should buy to use the most of your resources.
